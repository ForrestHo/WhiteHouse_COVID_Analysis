Dr. Deborah Birx discussed testing and trends, including declining fatalities which continue to decline week over week– on Sunday, fatalities were nearly 10 times lower than they were at the peak a few months ago. Dr. Birx also requested that governors encourage relevant individuals who have recovered from COVID-19 to donate plasma. Several governors discussed the increase in positive cases in individuals under the age of 35. The Vice President Pence asked governors to provide updates on recent testing and trends, provided an update on CDC support in those states, including discussion on county-specific observations. HHS Admiral Brett Giroir provided an update on community-based testing and testing support. Secretary Azar discussed the shipments of the second round of remdesivir which began shipping last week. CMS Administrator Seema Verma stressed that State leaders should redouble their efforts to prioritize the protection of vulnerable seniors, particularly those in nursing homes long-term care facilities. Rear Admiral John Polowczyk provided a logistics update on the expansion of domestic production of key resources (including N95s), restocking the National Stockpile and coordinating with States on their warehousing efforts, delivering PPE to nursing homes, building ventilators on-hand to over 35,000 in the National Stockpile (as of June 22). Since January 2020, the Trump Administration has led over 310 briefings – including 25 governors’ briefings – with over 131,000 State, local, and Tribal participants.\n"

EDT\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Thank you very much.\\xa0 Thank you.\\xa0 So beautiful out here.\\xa0 And thank you for joining us as we announce a massive and groundbreaking expansion in our testing capability of the — for the China virus.\\xa0 And as you know, it’s already setting records — records like nobody has ever seen before.\\nLast week, we crossed a historic milestone when the United States conducted our 100 millionth test, far more than any other country, and not even close, actually.\\xa0 Second seems to be India with 1.5 billion people, and the numbers would be probably at least 50 million more tests by us.\\xa0 We’ve conducted more tests than the entire European Union and more than all of Latin America combined.\\nWe’re thrilled to be joined by Vice President Mike Pence; Secretary of Health and Human Services Alex Azar; Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos — hi, Betsy; Administrator for the Centers for Medicine and Medicaid Services Seema Verma — Seema;\\xa0 and Admiral Giroir, who’s done such an incredible job.\\xa0 Thank you, Admiral.\\nWe’re also joined by Mississippi Governor Tate Reeves.\\xa0 Had a tremendous victory.\\xa0 We’re so proud of you.\\xa0 And as well by Abbott CEO Robert Ford.\\xa0 Robert, thank you very much.\\xa0 Great job.\\nToday, I’m pleased to report that we’re announcing our plan to distribute 150 million Abbott rapid point-of-care tests in the coming weeks — very, very soon.\\xa0 This will be more than double the number of tests already performed.\\xa0 And here’s our plan: Fifty million tests will go to protect the most vulnerable communities, which we’ve always promised to do, including 18 million for nursing homes; 15 million for assisted living facilities; 10 million for home, health, and hospece [sic] care — hospice care agencies; and nearly 1 million for historically black colleges and universities, and also tribal nation colleges.\\nOne hundred million rapid point-of-care tests will be given to states and territories to support efforts to reopen their economies and schools immediately and fast as they can.\\xa0 For example, the support my administration is providing would allow every state to, on a very regular basis, test every teacher who needs it.\\xa0 This continues our critical effort to use testing to protect high-risk communities.\\nThese new Abbott rapid point-of-care tests are easy to use and return results within just minutes.\\xa0 You’ll have a result at a maximum 15 minutes.\\xa0 Machine — no machine is required to process them.\\xa0 So, in the old days, when we just started this, you remember we’d go out and we’d have to find these massive laboratories with tremendously expensive equipment.\\xa0 Now we’re down to something that you’ll see that is really from a different planet.\\nI would like to ask Admiral Giroir to come up and demonstrate how these tests are performed.\\xa0 You’ll do this very nicely, I think.\\xa0 Good luck.\\xa0 Hope you don’t test positive.\\xa0 (Laughter.)\\nADMIRAL GIROIR:\\xa0 So, thank you, Mr. President.\\xa0 As of today, the nation has performed over 111 million tests for the virus causing COVID.\\xa0 On 13 separate days, we have achieved tests over 1 million per day, and our average test numbers are now approximately 920,000 per day.\\nWe are now at an inflection point in testing.\\xa0 We now have available, on average, 3 million tests per day, not counting pooled testing, which could multiply that number several fold.\\xa0 Nearly half of our current tests are rapid point-of-care.\\nAll of the actions of your administration — including aggressive use of multiple titles of the DPA; hundreds of millions of dollars in HHS and DOD investments; and regulatory flexibility, including over 200 FDA emergency use authorizations, CLIA enforcement discretion, and application of the PREP Act — have led us to this inflection point, which brings us why we’re here today.\\nOn August 27th, after months of planning and only after one day after the FDA authorization, the Trump administration awarded a contract for $760 million to Abbott for the delivery of 150 million of these Abbott BinaxNOW rapid tests.\\xa0 The BinaxNOW detects the presence of the COVID antigen.\\xa0 It uses a specific nasal swab, and that swab comes with the test, and it’s made by Puritan.\\xa0 And the reason why Puritan swabs are here is because the administration used the DPA and $120 million in investment to make these swabs able to use by Abbott.\\xa0 It does not require an instrument to determine the result.\\xa0 It’s 15 — it’s in 15 minutes, the result.\\nTesting may be performed by laboratories with a clear certificate of waiver.\\xa0 This is not a home test.\\xa0 But during the health emergency, Seema Verma and CMS permits laboratories to extend their certificate to operate in temporary sites, like schools or churches or parking lots.\\nSo though we anticipate that the test will generally be performed by a trained individual on a patient, I will demonstrate a self-swab for you to show you just exactly how easy the test is performed.\\nSo, literally, it almost could not be easier.\\xa0 It starts with six drops of liquid onto this piece of paper — one, two three, four, five, six.\\xa0 And then there’s a nasal swab.\\xa0 And again, this is — this is not the deep brain biopsy that we talk about.\\xa0 This will be generally done by a healthcare provider, but it can be done supervised.\\xa0 It’s this easy: one, two, three, four, five.\\xa0 One, two, three, four, five.\\xa0 Into the test.\\xa0 Twist it three times.\\xa0 The adhesive is pulled off, and you wait 15 minutes.\\xa0 And that is the test.\\xa0 It really could not be easier than this.\\xa0 This is a very sophisticated little piece of cardboard with lots of antibodies and incredible technology into that.\\nWe’ve already shipped 65,000 of these to disaster operations in California, Oregon, Texas, and Louisiana, and we have already shipped 2.1 million tests to 7,600 nursing homes, over 900,000 tests to assisted living, 300,000 tests to the Indian Health Service, and 339,000 tests to historically black colleges and universities.\\nToday, we start the shipment of 100 million tests to governors, beginning with a total of 6.5 million tests this week — to be shipped this week.\\xa0 This is in addition to the continuing support to other priorities, like nursing homes.\\xa0 Allocation to states and territories is based strictly on their relative population.\\nGovernors have the flexibility to use these tests as they deem fit, but we strongly encourage governors to utilize them in settings that are uniquely in need of rapid, low-tech, point-of- care tests, like opening and keeping open our K-through-12 schools; supporting critical infrastructure and first responders; responding to outbreak, specifically in certain demographics or locations; and screening of surveillance in congregate settings.\\nMr. President, we just completed a briefing to the governors and their state health officials from the Sit Room, and we heard words like “game changer” for their states.\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President, for your leadership and support of all our efforts to defeat this virus.\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Thank you very much, Admiral.\\xa0 And let me ask you, Governor Reeves, do you — do agree?\\xa0 Would you like to say something?\\nGOVERNOR REEVES:\\xa0 Well, thank you, Mr. President, for your leadership through this pandemic and through this crisis.\\xa0 This is — it was said by Republicans and Democrats alike earlier — this is a game changer.\\nIn our state of Mississippi, our K-through-12 schools have been open for nine weeks.\\xa0 Our institutions of higher learning have been open for about the same.\\xa0 But while we have testing available now at least once a week in every county of our state, what this allocation is going to allow for us is we will have testing available for our K-through-12 teachers every single day going forward.\\nAnd the thing that we know is that kids learn — and Secretary DeVos knows this so well — kids learn so much better when they’re in the classroom than when they’re doing distance learning or a hybrid.\\xa0 And while we have 75 to 80 percent of our kids back in the classroom, we want to get 100 percent of our kids back in the classroom.\\nIt is also critically important, Mr. President — your decision to allocate, on the front end, to the historically black colleges and universities means the world to Mississippi.\\xa0 Our larger institutions have the financial resources to provide testing, but in Mississippi, with Jackson State University and Alcorn University — Alcorn State University and Mississippi Valley State University, three of our eight institutions of higher learning will get an allocation of these tests, and it’s going to make a difference.\\xa0 And kids all across our state are going to be better served because of it.\\nAnd I want to personally thank you on behalf of the residents of Mississippi for doing this, Mr. President.\\xa0 Thank you.\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Thank you very much.\\xa0 Thank you, Tate.\\xa0 Great job.\\nIn a short period of time, my administration has built the most advanced testing system in the world.\\xa0 There’s never been anything like this.\\nWhen the pandemic struck, there were zero tests for the China virus, but we’ve marshaled all of America’s resources to achieve these unparalleled capabilities.\\nWe slashed red tape and approved emergency use authorizations for 243 type of tests.\\xa0 That’s how many tests we have.\\xa0 I invoked the Defense Production Act and related authorities more than 100 times and distributed $171 million to expand testing production.\\nWe’ve done nearly twice as much testing per capita as France, Italy, and Germany, and over six times more testing per capita than South Korea.\\xa0 We’ve done far more than any other country, usually times two, three, four, five, or six.\\xa0 We’ve performed nearly 40 million more tests than India.\\nAnd by the end of next month, we will have over 100 million tests available in the market.\\xa0 More than half will be point-of-care tests — those are the quick ones and they’re really the ones that have the best impact with the results in less than 15 minutes.\\nWe’ve also prioritized resources for the most vulnerable, including nursing home residents.\\xa0 We delivered rapid testing devices to nearly 14,000 certified nursing homes.\\nWe opened over 1,000 community testing sites in low-income communities.\\xa0 Nobody could have done this.\\xa0 We invested an unprecedented $8 billion to help tribal communities have the tests and resources they need to combat the virus.\\nAnd it’s important to remember that as younger and healthier people return to work, and as we massively increase testing capacity, we will identify more cases and asymptomatic individuals in low-risk populations.\\xa0 This should not cause undue alarm.\\xa0 The total number of cases is not the full metric of success.\\xa0 Hospitalization capacity and mortality rates are far more instructive metrics.\\nAs we do more tests, you’re going to have automatically more cases.\\xa0 We are relentlessly focused on protecting the vulnerable while enabling healthy Americans to go back to work.\\xa0 We can do both as Florida, Arizona, and other states have recently shown.\\nOver the last eight weeks, hospitalizations have declined by 48 percent, and they’ve just reached the lowest point since March.\\xa0 That’s a long time ago.\\nDue to advances in treatment, the fatality rate has fallen 85 percent since April.\\xa0 Our excess mortality has been considerably lower than comparable countries.\\xa0 Excess mortality compares total deaths during a pandemic to what we would be expected in a normal year.\\xa0 This is a critical measurement because it includes undetected China virus deaths, along with deaths resulting from lockdowns.\\xa0 And lockdowns can be very harmful, and we have too many states that are locked down right now.\\xa0 The governors are — nobody knows what the governors are doing, actually.\\nEurope has experienced a 50 percent greater excess mortality rate during the virus than the U.S., and their economic contraction has been far more severe.\\xa0 Under Operation Warp Speed, my administration is on track to deliver a safe and effective vaccine in record time.\\xa0 We’re doing very well with the vaccines, as most of you know.\\nFour vaccines are now in the final stage of trials.\\xa0 The day the vaccine is approved by the FDA, we’ll begin distributing it within 24 hours, with hundreds of millions of doses to follow very quickly.\\xa0 We’re all set to go.\\xa0 We’re all ready.\\xa0 And logistically, we’re — we have the military lined up, and some incredible people are just waiting to have it.\\nOver 100 million doses will be available before the end of the year.\\xa0 We will defeat the virus and we will end the pandemic.\\xa0 And next year will be one of the greatest years in our history, and we think it’s going to be a very exciting period of time.\\nWith that, I’d like to ask Mike to say a few words because you just left a task force meeting.\\xa0 Vice President Mike Pence.\\nTHE VICE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Thank you, Mr. President.\\xa0 This is a historic day.\\xa0 And other than the day that I believe will come soon — that America produces the first safe and effective vaccine — what’s announced today, with the distribution of 150 million rapid point-of-care tests all across America, it’s a testament to your leadership, Mr. President; it’s a testament to this great team that you’ve assembled from Secretary Azar, Admiral Giroir, and others; it’s a testament to the partnership that we forged with governors, like Governor Reeves, all across America.\\nAnd it’s a testament to great companies like Abbott Laboratories and the thousands of employees who, Mr. President, I know have literally worked around the clock since those early days in this pandemic, when you brought in the greatest research companies in America and said that “We need medicines known as therapeutics.\\xa0 We need a vaccine for America.”\\xa0 But you also challenged them to develop a rapid point-of-care test that could be distributed all across America and enabled us to more effectively slow the spread, flatten the curve, protect the vulnerable, and save lives.\\nNow, Mr. President, today’s announcement is really emblematic of the public-private partnership that you forged from the early days of this pandemic.\\xa0 As you said, we met today with the nation’s governors.\\xa0 The White House Coronavirus Task Force completed our 38th conference call with America’s governors.\\nBut all along the way, from our very first meeting, you made it clear that we’d spare no expense of the federal government — the full resources of the federal government you made available to put the health of America first.\\nBut you also challenged us and you challenged American industry to bring the full power and innovation of the American economy to bear on this moment.\\xa0 And whether it be PPE, where we forged a partnership to see to the delivery and the manufacture of hundreds of millions of personal protective equipment; whether it be how we started with 15,000 ventilators in the Strategic National Stockpile — and today, in partnership with GE Healthcare, Ford, and General Motors, we have over 150,000 ventilators in the Strategic National Stockpile; whether it be the extraordinary progress on therapeutics — remdesivir, convalescent plasma — that are literally saving lives; or whether it be, as you reflected, Mr. President, on our steady progress toward achieving a safe and effective vaccine before the end of this year, it’s been that public-private partnership that you’ve led that’s made these advances possible.\\nAnd on testing, the American people really deserve to know that when we began, as you said, Mr. President, it was literally a standing start.\\xa0 We didn’t have information on the coding of the coronavirus until mid-February.\\xa0 But America’s CDC labs and public health labs did their level best, and by the end of February, we’d done less than 10,000 coronavirus tests.\\nBut as you just announced a few moments ago, last week, we cleared 100 million tests all across the country.\\xa0 It’s extraordinary we have the capacity to do 3 million tests a day.\\xa0 It’s a testament to American innovation and the leadership that you’ve provided.\\nAlso, Mr. President, we’ve delivered, to nearly 14,000 nursing homes in America, point-of-care tests already that are making it possible for us to really keep focus on the most vulnerable.\\xa0 As you know, only 8 percent of those who have contracted the coronavirus are in nursing homes, but 40 percent of those that have lost their life have been in nursing homes.\\xa0 And so we’ve surged those resources and surged them to vulnerable populations.\\nBut with the announcement today of this Abbott Laboratories’ BinaxNOW test, we began a process first announcing 50 million tests to go to our vulnerable communities, to go to minority communities, to Indian Health Services.\\xa0 But as we told all the nation’s governors today, we begin the process this week of distributing 100 million tests to each state and territory in the country free of charge, so they can begin to deploy those tests to — on the priorities that the state set.\\nBut, Mr. President, given the extraordinary capacity that we have in testing today, we expressed a hope to all the governors today that they would particularly use these Abbott Binax tests to open up America’s schools and to keep them open.\\xa0 And we heard about the enthusiasm of governors from — on both sides of the aisle about what this test will mean and in helping to process — helping to process the testing that will get our kids into school and keep our kids in school.\\nAnd, Mr. President, let me just close by saying this is a — we’ve passed through a challenging time in the life of this nation in 2020, and our hearts — and I know your heart — is with all the families that have suffered loss.\\nBut as you said, cases are declining, hospitalizations have been declining — declining dramatically, particularly in the Sun Belt.\\xa0 In Louisiana, where, not long ago, 50 parishes had more than 10 percent positivity rate, now only 3 parishes are testing positive over 10 percent.\\xa0 Arizona was testing 20 percent positivity rate; now it’s less than 4 percent consistently.\\nBut with cases and positivity rising in 10 states in the Midwest and the near west; and with this historic advance in testing that’s being distributed — 150 strong around the country; Mr. President, the American people should anticipate that — that cases will rise in the days ahead.\\nBut as we — as we more readily identify those who’ve contracted the coronavirus, the American people can be confident, because of this extraordinary and historic public and pri- — private-partnership that you’ve forged, because of this whole-of-government approach, we’re ready, as we proved through the outbreak in the Sun Belt this summer.\\xa0 And we’ll make sure that any community, any state that’s impacted with rising cases, any school that’s impacted will have the PPE, will have the supplies, will have the medicines.\\nAnd as you said, Mr. President, we will continue, at your direction, our relentless drive toward achieving the first safe and effective vaccine so we can achieve the day that we once and for all put this coronavirus in the past.\\nSo, Mr. President, with thanks to our industry partners, thanks to this team, but thanks to you for your strong leadership, I hope for that day.\\xa0 And the American people can be confident we will not rest, we will not relent until we put this coronavirus in the past.\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Thank you very much, Mike.\\nScott Atlas, would you say a few words, please, as to how we’re doing and where you see us going?\\xa0 Please.\\nDR. ATLAS:\\xa0 Okay, thank you, Mr. President.\\xa0 And I also want to echo the congratulations to the team, the task force — Admiral Giroir, in particular, who’s worked very hard on the testing.\\nThis is a remarkable day because we have state-of-the art testing.\\xa0 This is not the typical point-of-care test, even; this is new.\\xa0 This is — does not require any kind of machine.\\xa0 It’s very rapid.\\xa0 And this is not one of those deep swab things that people are reluctant to use.\\xa0 So I think we’re — we’re really making an advance here to do what testing is supposed to do, and that’s to save lives.\\nAs the Vice President mentioned, we know that there are areas of the country that have more cases.\\xa0 This is to be expected with more social mingling.\\xa0 And the testing — but particularly protecting the vulnerable, is the key here.\\xa0 We have not seen hospital overcrowding.\\xa0 We’re doubling down now with testing to protect vulnerable people not just inside nursing homes, but in residential settings and senior daycare centers.\\nThis is a remarkable advance.\\xa0 And I anticipate that as — as this virus — as we get toward the end of this pandemic — and the vaccine is being developed as quickly as it has been — America will be in a different position.\\xa0 And there really should be — as I’ve said many times, the fear is not the issue here.\\xa0 We really have a handle on what’s going on.\\xa0 We know what to anticipate, and there’s remarkable advances being made as we see today.\\nThank you very much.\\nTHE PRESIDENT:\\xa0 Well, thank you very much.\\xa0 Tremendous progress is being made.\\xa0 And I say, and I’ll say it all the time: We’re rounding the corner.\\xa0 And, very importantly, vaccines are coming, but we’re rounding the corner regardless.\\xa0 But vaccines are coming, and they’re coming fast.\\xa0 We have four great companies already, and it’s going to be added to very rapidly.\\xa0 They’re in final stages of testing.\\xa0 And from what we’re hearing, the results are going to be very extraordinary.\\nSo thank you very much.\\xa0 I appreciate it.\\xa0 And thank you very much.\\xa0 Great job by Abbott.\\xa0 Right from the beginning, great job Abbott.\\nThank you.\\xa0 Thank you very much, everybody.\\xa0 Thank you.\\xa0 (Applause.)\\n\\nEND\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 4:07 P.M.

groundbreaking expansion in our testing capability of the — for the china virus  and as you know it’s already setting records — records like nobody has ever seen before last week we crossed a historic milestone when the united states conducted our  millionth test far more than any other country and not even close actually  second seems to be india with  billion people and the numbers would be probably at least  million more tests by us  we’ve conducted more tests than the entire european union and more than all of latin america combined we’re thrilled to be joined by vice president mike pence secretary of health and human services alex azar secretary of education betsy devos — hi betsy administrator for the centers for medicine and medicaid services seema verma — seema  and admiral giroir who’s done such an incredible job  thank you admiral we’re also joined by mississippi governor tate reeves  had a tremendous victory  we’re so proud of you  and as well by abbott ceo robert ford  robert thank you very much  great job today i’m pleased to report that we’re announcing our plan to distribute  million abbott rapid pointofcare tests in the coming weeks — very very soon  this will be more than double the number of tests already performed  and here’s our plan fifty million tests will go to protect the most vulnerable communities which we’ve always promised to do including  million for nursing homes  million for assisted living facilities  million for home health and hospece sic care — hospice care agencies and nearly  million for historically black colleges and universities and also tribal nation colleges one hundred million rapid pointofcare tests will be given to states and territories to support efforts to reopen their economies and schools immediately and fast as they can  for example the support my administration is providing would allow every state to on a very regular basis test every teacher who needs it  this continues our critical effort to use testing to protect highrisk communities these new abbott rapid pointofcare tests are easy to use and return results within just minutes  you’ll have a result at a maximum  minutes  machine — no machine is required to process them  so in the old days when we just started this you remember we’d go out and we’d have to find these massive laboratories with tremendously expensive equipment  now we’re down to something that you’ll see that is really from a different planet i would like to ask admiral giroir to come up and demonstrate how these tests are performed  you’ll do this very nicely i think  good luck  hope you don’t test positive  laughter admiral giroir  so thank you mr president  as of today the nation has performed over  million tests for the virus causing covid  on  separate days we have achieved tests over  million per day and our average test numbers are now approximately  per day we are now at an inflection point in testing  we now have available on average  million tests per day not counting pooled testing which could multiply that number several fold  nearly half of our current tests are rapid pointofcare all of the actions of your administration — including aggressive use of multiple titles of the dpa hundreds of millions of dollars in hhs and dod investments and regulatory flexibility including over  fda emergency use authorizations clia enforcement discretion and application of the prep act — have led us to this inflection point which brings us why we’re here today on august th after months of planning and only after one day after the fda authorization the trump administration awarded a contract for  million to abbott for the delivery of  million of these abbott binaxnow rapid tests  the binaxnow detects the presence of the covid antigen  it uses a specific nasal swab and that swab comes with the test and it’s made by puritan  and the reason why puritan swabs are here is because the administration used the dpa and  million in investment to make these swabs able to use by abbott  it does not require an instrument to determine the result  it’s  — it’s in  minutes the result testing may be performed by laboratories with a clear certificate of waiver  this is not a home test  but during the health emergency seema verma and cms permits laboratories to extend their certificate to operate in temporary sites like schools or churches or parking lots so though we anticipate that the test will generally be performed by a trained individual on a patient i will demonstrate a selfswab for you to show you just exactly how easy the test is performed so literally it almost could not be easier  it starts with six drops of liquid onto this piece of paper — one two three four five six  and then there’s a nasal swab  and again this is — this is not the deep brain biopsy that we talk about  this will be generally done by a healthcare provider but it can be done supervised  it’s this easy one two three four five  one two three four five  into the test  twist it three times  the adhesive is pulled off and you wait  minutes  and that is the test  it really could not be easier than this  this is a very sophisticated little piece of cardboard with lots of antibodies and incredible technology into that we’ve already shipped  of these to disaster operations in california oregon texas and louisiana and we have already shipped  million tests to  nursing homes over  tests to assisted living  tests to the indian health service and  tests to historically black colleges and universities today we start the shipment of  million tests to governors beginning with a total of  million tests this week — to be shipped this week  this is in addition to the continuing support to other priorities like nursing homes  allocation to states and territories is based strictly on their relative population governors have the flexibility to use these tests as they deem fit but we strongly encourage governors to utilize them in settings that are uniquely in need of rapid lowtech pointof care tests like opening and keeping open our kthrough schools supporting critical infrastructure and first responders responding to outbreak specifically in certain demographics or locations and screening of surveillance in congregate settings mr president we just completed a briefing to the governors and their state health officials from the sit room and we heard words like “game changer” for their states  thank you mr president for your leadership and support of all our efforts to defeat this virus the president  thank you very much admiral  and let me ask you governor reeves do you — do agree  would you like to say something governor reeves  well thank you mr president for your leadership through this pandemic and through this crisis  this is — it was said by republicans and democrats alike earlier — this is a game changer in our state of mississippi our kthrough schools have been open for nine weeks  our institutions of higher learning have been open for about the same  but while we have testing available now at least once a week in every county of our state what this allocation is going to allow for us is we will have testing available for our kthrough teachers every single day going forward and the thing that we know is that kids learn — and secretary devos knows this so well — kids learn so much better when they’re in the classroom than when they’re doing distance learning or a hybrid  and while we have  to  percent of our kids back in the classroom we want to get  percent of our kids back in the classroom it is also critically important mr president — your decision to allocate on the front end to the historically black colleges and universities means the world to mississippi  our larger institutions have the financial resources to provide testing but in mississippi with jackson state university and alcorn university — alcorn state university and mississippi valley state university three of our eight institutions of higher learning will get an allocation of these tests and it’s going to make a difference  and kids all across our state are going to be better served because of it and i want to personally thank you on behalf of the residents of mississippi for doing this mr president  thank you the president  thank you very much  thank you tate  great job in a short period of time my administration has built the most advanced testing system in the world  there’s never been anything like this when the pandemic struck there were zero tests for the china virus but we’ve marshaled all of america’s resources to achieve these unparalleled capabilities we slashed red tape and approved emergency use authorizations for  type of tests  that’s how many tests we have  i invoked the defense production act and related authorities more than  times and distributed  million to expand testing production we’ve done nearly twice as much testing per capita as france italy and germany and over six times more testing per capita than south korea  we’ve done far more than any other country usually times two three four five or six  we’ve performed nearly  million more tests than india and by the end of next month we will have over  million tests available in the market  more than half will be pointofcare tests — those are the quick ones and they’re really the ones that have the best impact with the results in less than  minutes we’ve also prioritized resources for the most vulnerable including nursing home residents  we delivered rapid testing devices to nearly  certified nursing homes we opened over  community testing sites in lowincome communities  nobody could have done this  we invested an unprecedented  billion to help tribal communities have the tests and resources they need to combat the virus and it’s important to remember that as younger and healthier people return to work and as we massively increase testing capacity we will identify more cases and asymptomatic individuals in lowrisk populations  this should not cause undue alarm  the total number of cases is not the full metric of success  hospitalization capacity and mortality rates are far more instructive metrics as we do more tests you’re going to have automatically more cases  we are relentlessly focused on protecting the vulnerable while enabling healthy americans to go back to work  we can do both as florida arizona and other states have recently shown over the last eight weeks hospitalizations have declined by  percent and they’ve just reached the lowest point since march  that’s a long time ago due to advances in treatment the fatality rate has fallen  percent since april  our excess mortality has been considerably lower than comparable countries  excess mortality compares total deaths during a pandemic to what we would be expected in a normal year  this is a critical measurement because it includes undetected china virus deaths along with deaths resulting from lockdowns  and lockdowns can be very harmful and we have too many states that are locked down right now  the governors are — nobody knows what the governors are doing actually europe has experienced a  percent greater excess mortality rate during the virus than the us and their economic contraction has been far more severe  under operation warp speed my administration is on track to deliver a safe and effective vaccine in record time  we’re doing very well with the vaccines as most of you know four vaccines are now in the final stage of trials  the day the vaccine is approved by the fda we’ll begin distributing it within  hours with hundreds of millions of doses to follow very quickly  we’re all set to go  we’re all ready  and logistically we’re — we have the military lined up and some incredible people are just waiting to have it over  million doses will be available before the end of the year  we will defeat the virus and we will end the pandemic  and next year will be one of the greatest years in our history and we think it’s going to be a very exciting period of time with that i’d like to ask mike to say a few words because you just left a task force meeting  vice president mike pence the vice president  thank you mr president  this is a historic day  and other than the day that i believe will come soon — that america produces the first safe and effective vaccine — what’s announced today with the distribution of  million rapid pointofcare tests all across america it’s a testament to your leadership mr president it’s a testament to this great team that you’ve assembled from secretary azar admiral giroir and others it’s a testament to the partnership that we forged with governors like governor reeves all across america and it’s a testament to great companies like abbott laboratories and the thousands of employees who mr president i know have literally worked around the clock since those early days in this pandemic when you brought in the greatest research companies in america and said that “we need medicines known as therapeutics  we need a vaccine for america”  but you also challenged them to develop a rapid pointofcare test that could be distributed all across america and enabled us to more effectively slow the spread flatten the curve protect the vulnerable and save lives now mr president today’s announcement is really emblematic of the publicprivate partnership that you forged from the early days of this pandemic  as you said we met today with the nation’s governors  the white house coronavirus task force completed our th conference call with america’s governors but all along the way from our very first meeting you made it clear that we’d spare no expense of the federal government — the full resources of the federal government you made available to put the health of america first but you also challenged us and you challenged american industry to bring the full power

and on testing the american people really deserve to know that when we began as you said mr president it was literally a standing start  we didn’t have information on the coding of the coronavirus until midfebruary  but america’s cdc labs and public health labs did their level best and by the end of february we’d done less than  coronavirus tests but as you just announced a few moments ago last week we cleared  million tests all across the country  it’s extraordinary we have the capacity to do  million tests a day  it’s a testament to american innovation and the leadership that you’ve provided also mr president we’ve delivered to nearly  nursing homes in america pointofcare tests already that are making it possible for us to really keep focus on the most vulnerable  as you know only  percent of those who have contracted the coronavirus are in nursing homes but  percent of those that have lost their life have been in nursing homes  and so we’ve surged those resources and surged them to vulnerable populations but with the announcement today of this abbott laboratories’ binaxnow test we began a process first announcing  million tests to go to our vulnerable communities to go to minority communities to indian health services  but as we told all the nation’s governors today we begin the process this week of distributing  million tests to each state and territory in the country free of charge so they can begin to deploy those tests to — on the priorities that the state set but mr president given the extraordinary capacity that we have in testing today we expressed a hope to all the governors today that they would particularly use these abbott binax tests to open up america’s schools and to keep them open  and we heard about the enthusiasm of governors from — on both sides of the aisle about what this test will mean and in helping to process — helping to process the testing that will get our kids into school and keep our kids in school and mr president let me just close by saying this is a — we’ve passed through a challenging time in the life of this nation in  and our hearts — and i know your heart — is with all the families that have suffered loss but as you said cases are declining hospitalizations have been declining — declining dramatically particularly in the sun belt  in louisiana where not long ago  parishes had more than  percent positivity rate now only  parishes are testing positive over  percent  arizona was testing  percent positivity rate now it’s less than  percent consistently but with cases and positivity rising in  states in the midwest and the near west and with this historic advance in testing that’s being distributed —  strong around the country mr president the american people should anticipate that — that cases will rise in the days ahead but as we — as we more readily identify those who’ve contracted the coronavirus the american people can be confident because of this extraordinary and historic public and pri — privatepartnership that you’ve forged because of this wholeofgovernment approach we’re ready as we proved through the outbreak in the sun belt this summer  and we’ll make sure that any community any state that’s impacted with rising cases any school that’s impacted will have the ppe will have the supplies will have the medicines and as you said mr president we will continue at your direction our relentless drive toward achieving the first safe and effective vaccine so we can achieve the day that we once and for all put this coronavirus in the past so mr president with thanks to our industry partners thanks to this team but thanks to you for your strong leadership i hope for that day  and the american people can be confident we will not rest we will not relent until we put this coronavirus in the past the president  thank you very much mike scott atlas would you say a few words please as to how we’re doing and where you see us going  please dr atlas  okay thank you mr president  and i also want to echo the congratulations to the team the task force — admiral giroir in particular who’s worked very hard on the testing this is a remarkable day because we have stateofthe art testing  this is not the typical pointofcare test even this is new  this is — does not require any kind of machine  it’s very rapid  and this is not one of those deep swab things that people are reluctant to use  so i think we’re — we’re really making an advance here to do what testing is supposed to do and that’s to save lives as the vice president mentioned we know that there are areas of the country that have more cases  this is to be expected with more social mingling  and the testing — but particularly protecting the vulnerable is the key here  we have not seen hospital overcrowding  we’re doubling down now with testing to protect vulnerable people not just inside nursing homes but in residential settings and senior daycare centers this is a remarkable advance  and i anticipate that as — as this virus — as we get toward the end of this pandemic — and the vaccine is being developed as quickly as it has been — america will be in a different position  and there really should be — as i’ve said many times the fear is not the issue here  we really have a handle on what’s going on  we know what to anticipate and there’s remarkable advances being made as we see today thank you very much the president  well thank you very much  tremendous progress is being made  and i say and i’ll say it all the time we’re rounding the corner  and very importantly vaccines are coming but we’re rounding the corner regardless  but vaccines are coming and they’re coming fast  we have four great companies already and it’s going to be added to very rapidly  they’re in final stages of testing  and from what we’re hearing the results are going to be very extraordinary so thank you very much  i appreciate it  and thank you very much  great job by abbott  right from the beginning great job abbott thank you  thank you very much everybody  thank you  applause  end                       pm edt '"
